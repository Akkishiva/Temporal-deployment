Deploying Temporal using Helm:


1. Add the Temporal Helm Repository:

helm repo add temporal http://go.temporal.io/helm-charts




   
2. Update the Helm Repository:


 helm repo update

  

3. Install Temporal with a Consistent Release Name:

helm install temporal temporal/temporal -f values.yaml



By using the release name `temporal` instead of `--generate-name`, you ensure that the service names remain consistent between delete and install operations. 

This method ensures that your service names don't change unnecessarily, which is crucial for stable application behavior and ease of management.

Summary 

-Avoid `--generate-name`: Using this option causes Helm to append a unique suffix to the release name each time you deploy, leading to changing service names.
 Specify a Static Release Name: By specifying a fixed release name (`temporal`), you ensure that the service names remain the same across deployments.

This approach is recommended for any Helm-managed application where consistent service naming is important.
